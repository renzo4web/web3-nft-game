# NFT Game

This project is a blockchain-based gaming application that allows users to create, mint, and battle with unique heroes represented as NFTs. This repository contains the code for the frontend of the application, built using React, Next.js, and Chakra UI.

I made this game to understand a little more about solidity, blockchain, contracts and how they interact with a frontend.

### Technologies Used
- *Hardhat*: Hardhat is a development environment and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts. It is used in this project to compile, deploy, and interact with the smart contracts that power the NFT functionality.

- *Next.js*: Next.js is a framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated React applications. It offers features like server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and efficient caching for improved performance.
- *Chakra UI*: Chakra UI is a simple and modular UI component library for React. It provides a set of accessible and customizable components that can be easily integrated into the application, allowing for rapid development and consistent design.
